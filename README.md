# Codes and Snippets from TidyTuesday Project

The TidyTuesday project is driven by [R For Data Science](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), where each week they put online a dataset with some cool article about it and ask us to make Exploratory Data Analysis. 

One can drive an Exploratory Data Analysis effort and see what it gets, or learning by seeing what other are doing in #rstats #tidytuesday community. Also, the [David Robinson YT Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/safe4democracy/featured) features screencasts of himself doing EDA, which is the best content to improve EDA skills.
